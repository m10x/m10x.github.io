## Prolog
In 2021, I chose web cache poisoning as the topic for [my bachelor's thesis](https://hackmanit.de/images/download/thesis/Automated-Scanning-for-Web-Cache-Poisoning-Vulnerabilities.pdf). I gathered all the known web cache poisoning techniques, sorted them into categories, and bundeled them into a scanner: the [Web Cache Vulnerability Scanner (wcvs)](https://github.com/Hackmanit/Web-Cache-Vulnerability-Scanner).
